This is a brand new, portable library for emulating the Atari Lynx.  I'm hoping
to build a good Atari Lynx debugger and emulator with it to support my Lynx
development efforts.

I cribbed heavily from the Lynx emulation code found in the Handy emulator.  I
converted the C++ in that code back to C for portability reasons and to make it
easier to port.  I used stdin.h for all variables and data type declarations.

If you use this library in a project, please let me know what you're 
using it for.  If you find a bug, let me know, or better yet, send me a 
patch to fix it ;-)

Enjoy!
